# CARF Redux
Like Cards Against Radio Frequency, but better! Uses the family pack of Cards Against Humanity to be FCC-friendly.

CARF Redux will have the following features:
- A built-in continuous-pulse FSK modem, so no external software is necessary!
- Browser-based interface, for even more convenience than the original CARF.
